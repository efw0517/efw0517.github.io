        The ADA has standards that web designers can follow to ensure that their
        websites are accessible by people with disabilities. However, less than
        2% of all websites follow these standards to their fullest. Therefore,
        the goal of the Inclusive Browsing Aid is to allow people who may need
        the extra assistance to browse the web more easily. Below is an
        explanation of the plugin's features, and you can even test some of the
        features on this page if you want! There's even an image below for you
        to test the "Image Captions" feature on!

          flashing colors to prevent seizures.

          Bionic Reading: studies have shown that bolding the first few letters
          of every word helps people with ADHD follow along with text better.
          So, this feature adjusts the text on a page to be compatible with
          Bionic Reading standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Color Contrast: depending on the color pallet of a page, color blind
          people may have a hard time deciphering what's on the page. This
          feature makes it so pages have more compatible color pallets.
