        Howdy, I'm Ethan Wyatt! I'm from Michigan and I've been attending
        Oakland University for 4 years. At Oakland University I major in
        computer science. I currently work at Motor City Systems as a "Frontend
        Developer". This means I have to use HTML, Typescript, and CSS to work
        on their constantly changing websites, that have various complicated
        funtionalities. In the future I would like to be a professional game
        developer.If you want to learn more about me, you can check out my
        <a href="../html/resume.html">"resume"</a> and
        <a href="../html/facts.html">"fun facts"</a> pages!
